# Linear Regression Project

This project uses linear regression to analyze customer behavior data with the goal of identifying key factors influencing spending. The dataset includes features such as average area income, house age, number of rooms, population, and usage patterns on mobile apps and websites.

## Objective

To build a predictive model for customer spending and determine whether the company should focus more on their mobile app or their website to maximize returns.

## Tools Used

- Python
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn
- plotly

## Key Insights

- Strong correlation observed between **Time spent on the mobile app** and **Yearly Amount Spent**.
- Website usage showed a weaker correlation with yearly spending.
- The linear regression model confirmed that **mobile app usage is a strong predictor** of yearly spending.

## Recommendation

> **They should clearly spend more energy on the mobile app than the website in order to maximize their returns.**
